\begin{abstract}
Mission-oriented innovation policies to address specific technological, social or economic challenges are being increasingly recognised as a promising strategy to steer innovation in societally desirable directions and encourage the formation of new disciplines and industries. We argue that developing a suitable evidence base for these policies requires the use of new data sources, analytical methods and indicators that reflect their rationale and pathways to impact and help manage their risks. We deploy these methods to develop prototype indicators in the empirical setting of the UK government Grand Challenge to \textit{`Use data, Artificial Intelligence and innovation to transform the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases by 2030`}. Our analysis of the active mission field of projects that combine AI and chronic disease-related keywords shows that although chronic diseases are underrepresented among AI projects, recent years have seen an expansion of activity and increasing involvement of medical researchers.  We also find that projects in the active mission field tend to combine more disciplines, involve new actors, and generate more applied outputs, consistent with the idea that it is opening high-impact opportunities in the intersection of fields.  We conclude with an experimental analysis of the `trajectories' of the active mission field based on a hierarchical topic model, showing that topics related to AI tend to be more prevalent that topics related to chronic diseases. This suggests that the exploration of research opportunities in the active mission field has been driven by computer scientists rather than medical scientists and biotechnologists. Having said this, the diversity of trajectories has stayed stable over time, consistent with the idea that the field is not settling prematurely into a dominant `solution' for its complex health challenge. Our findings highlight the potential of open data sources and data science methods for generating indicators to inform R\&I policies increasingly concerned with the rate and direction of deployment of emerging technologies, and its purposes.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Mission-oriented Research \& Innovation policies are systemic public policies that draw on frontier knowledge to attain specific goals or `big science deployed to meet big problems' \citep{mazzucato_mission-oriented_2018}. Missions are at the core of new €100bn EU proposal for Horizon Europe (released June 2018), and of the new industrial strategy developed by UK government, which is organised around the idea of `Grand Challenges’ that generate missions, as well as an `Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund’ that identifies particular challenges to be pursued through concerted policy action (HM Government, 2018). Some mission ideas and policies include \textit{`Reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions balance of 100 European cities by 2030'} (Mazzucato, 2018), or \textit{`Ensure that people can enjoy at least 5 extra healthy, independent years of life by 2035, while narrowing the gap between the experience of the richest and poorest'}. The figure below illustrates a mission specification from \cite{mazzucato_mission-oriented_2018}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption{A mission example (taken from \cite{mazzucato_mission-oriented_2018})}
    \label{fig:mission_example}
\end{figure}

Missions could help bridge worrying disconnects between technology development, societal well-being and productivity growth by actively encouraging the deployment of new technologies to tackle societal challenges and supporting the exploration of new technological trajectories where new ideas are `less hard' to find \citep{bloom_are_2017, cantner_elements_2018}. At the same time, missions present important risks: they could fail to target the most significant societal challenges resulting in a loss of legitimacy for their administrators and R\&I policy more widely, they may be unrealistic or unfeasible, or `pick winners' that are commercially unsustainable, rent-seeking or induce premature lock-in to weaker technologies \citep{aghion_science_2009}. 

Realising the potential of missions while managing these risks requires a suitable evidence base and indicators for prioritisation, targeting, monitoring and evaluation. In this paper, we contribute to this evidence base by developing prototype indicators focusing on one particular mission \- to transform the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases using `Artificial Intelligence, Data and Innovation' - announced by UK Government in 2018. In doing this, we explore the potential of open and text data and data science methods for generating relevant and inclusive indicators for R\&I policies increasingly concerned with the deployment of emerging technologies in particular directions. 

In the rest of this section, we review the literature about mission-oriented R\&I policies, highlighting their characteristics, rationales, risks and evidence needs, and outline the goals of the paper as well as our research questions. Having done this, in Section \ref{sec:methodology} we describe our methodology, including data collection, processing and enrichment activities, and the approach we have used to operationalise our focus mission in order to generate indicators about it. Section \ref{sec:findings} presents our findings and Section \ref{sec:conclusion} ends with a discussion of the implications of our analysis, its limitations and issues for further research.

\subsection{A rationale for innovation missions}
\label{subsec: history}

Missions are not new in R\&I policy. Some of humankind`s greatest technical achievements have resulted from missions. Some examples include the Longitude Reward, which encouraged the development of sea watches greatly improving the safety of sea travel in the 18th Century, the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb, or the Apollo program to put a man on the Moon \citep{nelson_moon_1977}. Mission-like policies also play an important part in the private sector through crowdsourcing challenges and competitions \citep{lakhani_attributes_2012}. 

One thing that sets the `new wave' of missions in R\&I policy apart from previous ones is their shift away from purely technical or economic problem\-solving, and their ambition to deploy science and technology to address big social challenges that people face in their daily lives \citep{mazzucato_mission-oriented_2018}. One implicit goal of this effort is to build popular support for R\&I policies that can otherwise feel removed from everyday aspirations and concerns about the environment, health, education and inequality \citep{mazzucato_mission-oriented_2018}. This move away from technical goals to social ones creates new challenges for R\&I policy and its stakeholders, as the goal of innovation research and policy shift from advancing knowledge and producing technical breakthroughs to achieving social changes which are harder to measure and in some cases even contested, as we see in ongoing debates about how to tackle climate change or increase social mobility \citep{nelson_moon_2011,mowery_technology_2010}. This broader and arguably more ambitious definition of missions also requires engaging a wider set of disciplines, overcoming barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration.

Another important reason for renewed interest in the mission framework is the notion that traditional R\&I policies based on market failure and system failure rationales ignore the directionality of technical change, have low additionality and tend to be captured by the status quo \citep{cantner_elements_2018,frenken_complexity-theoretic_2017}. In other words, they support incremental activities that might not be the most societally desirable, and in some cases would have been carried out anyway, generally by powerful, established incumbents \citep{frenken_complexity-theoretic_2017}. 

This way of thinking about the goals of R\&I policy draws on evolutionary economics and complexity science ideas suggesting that technological development is directional (it can unfold in many possible trajectories) and uncertain in outcomes. It also moves away from notions of optimality in technical change: The trajectories of development that are selected ‘from the bottom up’, for example by market forces might not be the most beneficial one if they generate unanticipated externalities and path dependences that prevent shifts away from it further down the line, as we see in the economy’s lock-in to environmentally unsustainable fossil fuels \citep{aghion_science_2009,david_clio_1985,arthur1994increasing};. Further. ‘normal’ R\&I takes place through an exploration of the ‘adjacent possible’ where bodies of knowledge that are technically closer tend to be recombined more often because they exist in the same organisation, or in related organisations \citep{hidalgo2017principle}. All this means that R\&I policies that simply seek to increase the amounts invested in R&D (as R\&D tax credits do under a market failure rationale) or the responsiveness of academic researchers to industry needs (as knowledge exchange programs informed by a systems failure rationale do) will fail to generate societally beneficial, boundary spanning innovations \citep{gustafsson_failure_2011}. 

Many recent expressions of dissatisfaction with the status quo of research and innovation policy reflect this view. Some examples include concerns about a `bubble' in biomedical research, an AI bias towards automating labour instead of complementing it, and evidence of a productivity puzzle where increasing investments on R\&D fail to produce corresponding improvements in productivity growth and societal well\-being \citep{jones_biomedical_2018, sarewitz_saving_2016, acemoglu_artificial_2018, restrepo_wrong_2018}

A mission-oriented R&I framework could help address these challenges: by definition, missions are directional. They identify preferred trajectories of technological development (in the examples we provided at the beginning, use of urban infrastructure and built space innovations to reduce carbon emissions, or of AI to tackle chronic diseases) and provide resources for pursuing them. They also encourage combinations of knowledge residing in faraway parts of the innovation system. This should yield new ideas for which there is not a market yet (otherwise these ideas would already be deployed to address the mission) \citep{gustafsson_failure_2011}. This could involve new players sitting in the intersection between disciplines, and with a greater tolerance for risk than the incumbents.  All these rationales are being marshalled to motivate the new wave of missions in the EU and the UK we alluded to in the introduction.

\subsection{Developing an evidence base for missions}

Innovation missions are not without risks, such as for example that R\&I policymakers without sufficient information `pick winners’ that are not feasible or commercially sustainable, that they are captured by new vested interests that coalesce around missions, or that they distort technology deployment leading to premature lock-in to weak standards and solutions \citep{aghion_science_2009}. 

Proponents of the new wave of mission-oriented policies have put in place specific criteria for mission selection and delivery to address these design and implementation challenges with the goal of ensuring that missions have legitimacy and broad social support, can be achieved, and bring together a broad mix of actors going beyond `the usual suspects'. The demand for bottom-up experimentation acknowledges uncertainty about which of the avenues that are explored through the mission will be successful, and the need to avoid picking winners that end in a technological or commercial dead-end.  

Table \ref{tab:criteria} summarizes their criteria and their implications for measurement.

(see table 1) (\citep{mazzucato_mission-oriented_2018}).

What does this mean for the evidence base for innovation missions?

First, an evidence base for missions should capture the extent to which the topic of a mission reflects societal interests and concerns, as well as the levels of social engagement with the mission topic, and with the mission itself. It is possible to generate indicators capturing the social relevance dimension of missions with data from opinion surveys, policy debates, news media and social media, as well as indicators about the severity and prevalence of the challenge that the mission seeks to address.

Second, the evidence base needs to consider the content of the R\&I activities taking place as part of the mission, and how they balance feasibility (the activities taking place need to be technologically achievable) and ambition (the activities would not have taken place without the mission). This can be measured with indicators reflecting the similarity (or differences) between R&I activities taking place as part of the mission and previous work, as well as the extent to which the projects taking place inside the mission generate applied outputs and technologies.

Third, it is also important to consider the diversity of activities that are being supported through the mission in terms of the disciplines, industries and actors involved: are these novel and unexpected, and do they involve new `entrants’? Here we can develop indicators measuring the disciplinary and industry mix of the activities supported by a mission, and compare the actors participating in it with those involved in areas outside of the mission. Over time, we would expect successful missions to change the structure of R&I networks, bringing key disciplines and the actors involved in them into new fields and communities.

Finally, the evidence base should capture the time\-lines and goals of the mission: what does it seek to achieve, over what period, and with what success. Some of the relevant indicators can be directly extracted from the specification of the mission (eg. reach zero greenhouse emissions by 2030). This is a different question from whether these indicators are being measured in a suitable way, and from the extent to which changes in those indicators (impacts) can be attributed to the mission itself (as compared to broader socio-economic trends and technological breakthroughs supported outside of the mission). 

\subsection{About this paper}
\label{subsec: about}

In this paper we develop and explore prototype indicators operationalising key dimensions of the evidence base for missions outlined above. We do this in the context of the UK Grand Challenge Mission to \textit{`Use data, Artificial Intelligence and innovation to transform the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases by 2030'}, and using data about research grant funding in the UK from the Gateway to Research open dataset. Our goal is to develop a flexible framework that can be used to query funding data and identify a `mission field'. 

We define a mission field as the set of R&I activities that are directly relevant for a mission. We establish relevance using a semantic approach that extracts keywords from the definition of a mission and then queries the funding corpus with a version of that keyword set expanded via semantic similarity in a word embedding space. Having identified relevant projects, we then create indicators about the mission field. All these activities are described in further detail in the Methodology and Findings sections below.

We focus on dimensions 2, 3, and 4 in Table 1, considering actors, activities and networks but not societal needs and impacts (see Figure \ref{fig:diagram} below for a summary). This decision is dictated by the open grant dataset we are focusing on (which is limited in its coverage of information about societal needs), and the fact that the innovation mission we are focusing on was only recently announced so it would be unrealistic to expect them to have produced visible impacts so early after launch. We discuss some avenues to generate indicators about other dimensions of the evidence base for missions in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

    \label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}

It is important to note that the UK Government only announced the Grand Challenge Mission about AI and chronic diseases in 2018. This means that much of our analysis will capture activities already taking place before the mission was launched. In that sense, our analysis should be seen as providing a baseline for the design, targeting and evaluation of the mission - an important function nevertheless.

\subsection{The mission domain: AI and chronic diseases}
\label{subsec: domain}

Our application domain are research grants in the UK related to the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. 

Why is a mission needed in this domain? 

It is widely acknowledged that powerful AI (and machine learning) technologies with strong predictive capabilities could transform how we deal with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer or diabetes \citep{cockburn_impact_2018, loder_confronting_2018, miotto2017deep, ravi2016deep}. The range of applications is broad, going from identifying the causes of these diseases, to predicting what individuals are at risk, and designing more effective personalised treatments for them (under the rubric of precision medicine). Ultimately, this will contribute to saving lives, improving wellbeing, and lowering costs in healthcare delivery by reducing the need for costly late-treatments (BEIS, 2019).

There is a widespread perception that applications of AI in the health domain are lagging behind other application areas such as advertising, social media or finance \citep{mulgan_artificial_2018, mateos-garcia_complex_2018}). There are multiple reasons for this including risks of prediction error, patient data protection and privacy issues, the importance of model explainability and barriers to deployment in large and complex health systems \citep{miotto2017deep}. Overcoming these barriers to the successful deployment of AI in health requires new combinations of knowledge and innovation actors that this mission seeks to encourage.

\subsection{Research questions}
\label{subsec: questions}

Focusing on the UK grand challenge to `Use data, Artificial Intelligence and innovation to transform the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases by 2030', we will seek to address the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the levels of activity and funding in this mission field?
    \item How have the levels of activity evolved over time?
    \item What is the disciplinary breakdown of the mission field?
    \item How has the disciplinary breakdown of the mission field evolved over time?
    \item What are the levels of interdisciplinarity in the mission field?
    \item What is the distribution of outcomes in the mission field?
    \item What actors are active in the mission field and what is their `novelty’?
    \item What is the diversity of technological trajectories in the mission field and how it is evolving over time?

\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Data sources}
\label{subsec:data}

The primary source of data that we use in this paper is UK Research and Innovation’s Gateway to Research (GtR). GtR is an open, linked database with information about all research activities funded by Research Councils and Innovate UK (the UK’s innovation agency), ranging from research grants in academia to innovation vouchers in industry. In January 2019 we queried GtR’s open Application Programming Interface (API) and extracted all the information in the database. In total, this includes information about just under 90,000 projects and 38,700 unique organisations.

For each research activity, we potentially have information about its subject and its starting date, the organisations and individual researchers involved, the amounts of funding awarded, and the outputs, including publications, patents, spin-outs and technology outputs (such as software) among others.

Given our reliance on text descriptions to identify relevant projects, and our interest in understanding mission feasibility (which requires information about project outputs which are, for example, not available for Innovate UK projects), we focus our analysis on the 37,478 grant applications with an informative description in the corpus.\footnote{This involves removing projects with missing and uninformative descriptions such as boilerplate text stating that a project description is not available for confidentiality reasons}. It is also worth noting that GtR only covers research activity systematically since 2006. 98\% of the projects in the data have a starting date in that year or later.

\subsection{Data processing and enrichment}
One area of interest for us is the level of disciplinary and industrial diversity in a mission field. However, projects in GtR are not classified into high-level research disciplines. They are however tagged with a `bottom-up’ taxonomy of 607 research topics. We build a research topic co-occurrence network that we analyse using community detection methods (more specifically, the Louvain algorithm) in order to identify sets of topics that tend to co-occur frequently in projects, and that we interpret as representations of higher level, latent, disciplines. The communities obtained through this analysis capture seven disciplines: \emph{`arts and humanities'}, \emph{`biological sciences'}, \emph{`engineering and technology'}, \emph{`environmental sciences'}, \emph{`mathematics and computing'}, \emph{`physics' and `social sciences'}.

We then use a supervised machine learning approach to classify projects into discipline. To do this, we identify `pure discipline’ projects that only have research topics from one discipline community and combine them into a labelled dataset that we use to train a machine learning model that predicts project discipline labels based on the (pre-processed) text in their abstract.\footnote{82\% of the projects in the data have research topics that belong to a single discipline. Since the Medical Research Council does not use research topics to label its projects, we assume that all the projects it funds are in the Medical Sciences.} We then use this model to predict the discipline mix for all projects in the data. Figure \ref{fig:discipline_classifier} shows model performance.

\footnote{We use grid search over a family of linear models and random forests with different levels of regularisation and leaf sizes, and three-fold cross validation. The best performing classifier is a logistic regression with L2 regularisation and balanced classes.} 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_3_model_validation.png}
    \caption{Figures with the result of the discipline classifier. The top barchart presents a stacked confusion matrix for every discipline representing different classification outcomes, and the bottom barchart presents the precision and recall of every model}
    \label{fig:discipline_classifier}
\end{figure}

Our discipline classifier performs strongly in most cases (the only exception being physics, where the discipline classifier displays lower levels of precision so we exclude it from the rest of our analysis).\footnote{The number of Physics projects in the active mission field was in any case negligible so our results are not affected by this decision.}

\subsection{Operationalising a mission}
In order to answer our research questions, we need to identify projects in the mission field for the AI and Chronic Diseases mission. To do this, we rely on the mission statement: to \textit{`use data, Artificial Intelligence and innovation to transform the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases by 2030'}. 

This mission statement contains the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{A subject:} Data, Artificial Intelligence and Innovation
    \item \textbf{A verb:} to Transform
    \item \textbf{An object:} Prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases
    \item \textbf{A timeline:} by 2030
\end{enumerate}

A research project that was completely within the mission would contain all of these elements in its abstract. It is however unlikely that we will find such a match in the data. For instance, few research projects will focus on more than one dimension of the object. Projects will frequently specialise in a single chronic disease or group of chronic diseases. Few projects will specify the dates when they expect to generate applicable findings since that is a policy goal, not a research goal.  We therefore distil the mission statement into the key components that we would expect to find in a research project abstract. They are the methodology they use (Artificial Intelligence) and their domain (Research on chronic conditions). 

From the point of view of the mission, the methodology is a tool, and the domain is a problem (health challenge) that the methodology seeks to address. Note that we remove from the methodologies terms such as ‘data’ or ‘innovation’ that are rather generic and likely to appear in many irrelevant abstracts. 

Having identified these mission components, we can define a potential mission field and an active mission field. The `potential mission field' comprises all projects that mention at least one mission component - in our case, the tool (AI) or the challenge (chronic diseases). The `active mission field’ comprises the projects that mention all mission components - in our case, the tool and the challenge: these are the most relevant projects from the point of view of the mission (see Figure \ref{fig:venn_diagram} below). One dimension of impact of a mission R\&I policy would be its ability to grow the active mission field at a faster rate that its mission components (reflecting increasing connectivity between them).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/fig_4_venn.png}
    \caption{Definition of an active mission field and an active mission field}
    \label{fig:venn_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Definition and expansion of the mission vocabulary}
\label{subsec:vocabulary}

The first step in our analysis is to identify the list of keywords that capture different components of a mission - in our case, AI and chronic diseases. In the case of AI, we use the keyword \emph{artificial intelligence} as well as other related terms such as \emph{machine learning} and specific methodologies and techniques such as \emph{deep learning} or \emph{text mining}.

In the case of chronic diseases, there is no consensus about their definition and the range of diseases and conditions that they include. Given this, we have opted for a crowd-sourced list of conditions from wikipedia. This includes the following terms: 

\emph{Addiction, Aids, Alzheimer’s, Atrial fibrillation, Autoimmune disease, Bipolar disorder, Blindness, Cancer, Cardiovascular disease, Cerebral palsy, Chronic condition, Chronic disease, Chronic hepatitis, Chronic pain, Deafness, Depression, Endometriosis, Epilepsy, Hiv, Huntington’s, Hypertension, Lupus, Lymes disease, Parkinsons, Sclerosis, Sickle cell anemia}.

We acknowledge that there is an element of arbitrariness in this definition of chronic diseases. In future applications, the identification of the mission vocabulary should be undertaken in collaboration with the policymakers who defined the mission in order to ensure that the mission field analysis captures the relevant domain.

In order to improve the recall of our queries (that is, our ability to capture relevant entities in the data), we perform a keyword expansion in our original list of terms. This expansion identifies other keywords that are similar to the terms in our original seed list based on their proximity in a word embedding space estimated using the \texttt{Word2Vec} algorithm \citep{mikolov_linguistic_2013}. This way, we hope to increase the recall of our results by identifying projects using synonyms of the words included in the initial search.

In order to obtain satisfactory results, we need to tune two parameters in our search algorithm. The first one is the \texttt{window} that \texttt{Word2Vec} takes into account when identifying the context for a given word (for example, short windows are better for identifying synonyms) and the second is the \texttt{similarity} threshold that we use to identify similar words within the word embedding space. We consider 30 combinations of values for these two parameters and then calculate the `model support' for different projects, that is, what proportion of models classify a project in category (eg AI). 

We split projects into groups based on their rank within the `model support' distribution and validate a subset of them manually in order to decide a cut-off point in the model support value. This entails, for every group, checking five projects with a model support above their threshold, and five projects below their threshold. This is the equivalent to checking for true positives (projects that would have been classified in a category such as AI because they have model support equal or above the threshold) and false negatives (projects that would not have been classified in the category because their model support is below the threshold). This leads us to select a validation threshold in the seven decile of model support, with a cutoff threshold of $0.46$ (i.e we consider as AI any projects which contains keywords related to AI according to at least 46\% of the \texttt{Word2Vec} models that we trained). With this threshold, our AI classification had precision and recall scores of 90\%.\footnote{We classify projects into the chronic disease category if their model support is above 50\%.}

The exhibit next page displays example descriptions of projects that contain both AI and chronic disease keywords. It suggest that even the relatively simple implementation of our vocabulary selection and keyword expansion method yields relevant projects. Having said this, we note that our classification approach is not able to differentiate between projects that specialise in the treatment of chronic diseases with AI methods and others where chronic diseases are an application among many. This is partly a consequence of the relatively short description of the projects that is available from the Gateway to Research.

\textbf{Efficient and Robust Assessment of Cardiovascular Disease Using Machine Learning and Ultrasound Imaging}

ABSTRACT EXCERPT: Heart disease is the number one killer in the world. Currently the best way of diagnosing heart disease and planning its treatment is to use a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. However, MRI scanners are expensive and not typically used for scanning hearts in most UK hospitals. Therefore, the best diagnosis and treatment are not available to all patients. Currently the most common way of assessing heart disease is through the use of an ultrasound scanner. Although ultrasound has many advantages, it does not have such good image quality as MRI and so there are difficulties associated with its use in heart disease management. If the 'gold standard' quality of assessment from MRI could somehow be made feasible using ultrasound it would have great potential benefits for patients.

This is the aim of this project. We aim to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques combined with rich multimodal imaging data to produce a computer model of heart disease and its associations with heart shape and motion. By incorporating MRI as well as ultrasound imaging data into the model we can exploit the power of MRI based only on ultrasound imaging. This would make possible a low cost and easy clinical pathway to the best care possible.

\textbf{Adaptive Automated Scientific Laboratory}
ABSTRACT EXCERPT: Our proposal integrates the scientific method with 21st century automation technology, with the goal of making scientific discovery more efficient (cheaper, faster, better). A Robot Scientist is a physically implemented laboratory automation system that exploits techniques from the field of artificial intelligence to execute cycles of scientific experimentation. Our vision is that within 10 years many scientific discoveries will be made by teams of human and robot scientists, and that such collaborations between human and robot scientists will produce scientific knowledge more efficiently than either could alone. In this way the productivity of science will be increased, leading to societal benefits: better food security, better medicines, etc. The Physics Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek has predicted that the best scientist in one hundred years time will be a machine. The proposed project aims to take that prediction several steps closer.

We will develop the AdaLab (an Adaptive Automated Scientific Laboratory) framework for semi-automated and automated knowledge discovery by teams of human and robot scientists. This framework will integrate and advance a number of ICT methodologies...

\textbf{Distributed Intelligent Learning Environment for Mammographic Screening}

ABSTRACT EXCERPT: Breast cancer is one of the major causes of death in the modern world. In the UK there is a national screening programme which women between ages of 50 and 70 can attend. Breast cancer screening involves taking breast X-Rays (called mammograms) and examining them for signs of cancer. The idea is that if cancers are detected and treated early (before there are noticeable symptoms) then treatments can be more effective. Examining mammograms for cancer is a highly skilled job carried out by trained radiologists who have to detect what are often very subtle abnormalities occurring only in a small proportion of the cases they examine. Our research will explore how computers can be effectively used to train radiologists to undertake the demanding task of breast screening. To do this we will develop and test an Intelligent Tutoring and e-Learning Environment (ITeLE) to provide instruction, support, practice and feedback for trainee radiologists intending to specialize in mammography...

\subsection{Topic modelling}
\label{subsec:topic}

In Subsection \ref{subsec:trajectory} we analyse the thematic composition of the active mission field - that is, what are the focus of research combining AI and chronic diseases in the UK: what applications does it seek to develop, with what purpose and in what disease area? This will help us calculate indicators about the distribution of activity in the mission field, and whether it is becoming more concentrated or diversified. 

We approach the problem using a topic modelling strategy aimed at identifying clusters of co-ocurring words in an automated, unsupervised way. To do this, we use \texttt{TopBSM}, a topic model based on the stochastic block model, a generative model that detects communities in graphs \citep{gerlach_network_2018}. \texttt{TopSBM} represents a corpus of documents that consist of words as a bipartite graph where words that co-occur in documents appear connected in the network, and where documents that share words also appear connected. Densely connected communities of words in the network capture topics while communities of documents capture clusters or segments of activity. Community detection is performed hierarchically making it possible to identify topics (and segments) with different levels of detail. \texttt{TopSBM} has some important advantages over other topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI): it makes weaker assumptions about the distribution that generates topics in a corpus, and it automatically estimates the number of topics in a document. 

We train \texttt{TopSBM} on our grant corpus after pre-processing the text (which involves tokenising documents, removing rare word and extracting bigrams and trigrams). Figure \ref{fig:topic_model} displays the different levels in the hierarchy of our topic model. We present the results of our analysis in Subsection \ref{subsec:trajectory}.

\section{Findings}
\label{sec:findings}

\subsection{Activity and evolution of the mission field}

The classification procedure described in Subsection \ref{subsec:vocabulary} leads us to identify $1,157$ projects in the AI category, and $5,056$ projects in the chronic disease category. The potential mission field (set of projects classified as AI \textit{or} chronic diseases) consists of $6,114$ projects and the active mission field comprising projects classified in AI \textit{and} chronic diseases comprises $99$ projects (1.6\% of the potential mission field).

Figure 6 shows the representation of chronic disease projects in AI compared to the population of projects overall, and the representation of AI projects in the population of chronic disease projects compared to the population of projects overall. If AI methods were distributed randomly across domains, we would expect the share of AI projects in chronic diseases to be similar to their share in the total.  To the contrary, we find that AI tends to be underrepresented in chronic disease research. We estimate that AI is 37\% less likely to be deployed in the domain of chronic diseases than what we would expect given its overall deployment in the data.\footnote{The differences in proportions are statistically significant according to a $Z-test$.}

This finding suggests that the UK mission's rationale - to spur the deployment of AI systems in the health domain - is valid given that it currently under-represents AI systems.\footnote{Here, it is worth noting that some AI projects are likely to be basic and therefore not applied in any fields. It would be useful to compare the representation of AI in chronic diseases with other application fields.} 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_6_mission_levels.pdf}
    \caption{Representation of AI in chronic disease research compared to the broader research population}
    \label{fig:active_field}
\end{figure}

We move to consider the evolution of the active mission field in figure \ref{fig:trends}. The two linecharts in the left compare the share of all projects (first row) and funding (second row) in a category (active mission field or its mission components, which we could think of as `controls') for every year. The two line-charts on the right consider the share of the active mission field in each mission component. We use 2-year moving averages in both cases to remove some of the volatility in the series.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_7_trends.pdf}
    \caption{Share of activity in a research category accounted by different years by number of projects and levels of funding (left column), and share of the active mission field in AI and chronic diseases in terms by projects and levels of funding (right column)}
    \label{fig:trends}
\end{figure}

The left column reveals a strong increase in project and funding activity for the active mission field in recent years (and particularly since 2014). By contrast, the amounts of project activity and funding for chronic diseases has remained stable in the same period. We note that the increase of activity in the active mission field is faster than in its AI components, implying that AI is now being deployed in the chronic disease field faster than in other domains.

In the right column, we also observe an upwards trend in the share of AI projects focused on chronic diseases, and in the share of chronic disease projects that use AI methods, both in terms of number of projects and level of funding.

This analysis suggests that the active mission field is expanding as researchers begin applying AI methods in the domain of chronic diseases. It is important to highlight that most of this activity precedes the announcement of the UK Grand Challenge in 2018, something that will have to be taken into account when evaluating the impact of the mission.

\subsection{Composition of the mission field}

\subsubsection{Disciplines}

What disciplines are participating in the active mission field?

Figure \ref{fig:disc_mix} shows the disciplinary distribution of projects in the active mission field and the mission components after allocating each project to its discipline with the highest probability according to our discipline classifier \footnote{We do this to avoid double-counting}. 

It shows that the mission field is dominated by projects approaching the chronic disease challenge from a Mathematics and Computing disciplinary lens, followed by projects with a Medical Sciences perspective, Engineering and Technology projects and projects from the Biological sciences and Biotechnology. Social sciences and Arts and Humanities have very limited representation in the mission field, suggesting that social, organisational, policy and cultural dimensions of the deployment of AI to treat chronic diseases are not receiving much attention currently.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_8_disciplines.pdf}
    \caption{Share of activity by category in each discipline (after classifying each project in its top discipline)}
    \label{fig:disc_mix}
\end{figure}

When we consider the evolution of the disciplinary composition of the active mission field in Figure \ref{fig:disc_mix}, we observe recent growth in the number of Medical Science and Biological Science projects, suggesting that after an initial period where most applications of AI in the chronic disease area were explored by computer scientists, AI methods are now starting to be deployed by medical researchers and bio-technologists.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_9_disc_trends.pdf}
    \caption{Projects in the active mission field by discipline and year (after classifying each project in its top discipline)}
    \label{fig:disc_mix}
\end{figure}

In the analysis above, we have classified each project into a single discipline. However, we can exploit the fact that our discipline classifier generates a vector of discipline probabilities for each project in order to study disciplinary overlaps. 

Figure \ref{fig:disc_count_discrete} presents the number of disciplines present in projects in the active mission field and the mission components.\footnote{We set a threshold of 0.1 to establish if a discipline is present in a project. The results are robust to changes in this threshold.} It shows that projects in the active mission field have a lower propensity to display a single discipline than projects in AI or Chronic Diseases, and a higher propensity to display projects with a presence of two and even three disciplines, consistent with the idea that activity in a mission field is more likely to involve broader disciplinary combinations. This view is confirmed in Figure 11, where we present a density plot of entropy in the discipline probability vector: projects in the active mission field tend to have larger entropy values, reflecting the presence of a broader range of disciplines inside them.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_10_disc_discrete.pdf}
    \caption{Number of disciplines present in projects in different categories}
    \label{fig:disc_count_discrete}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_11_disc_histogram.pdf}
    \caption{Entropy distribution by category}
    \label{fig:disc_count_discrete}
\end{figure}

What are the disciplines being combined in the active mission field?

Figure \ref{fig:disc_pairs} presents the presence of pairwise discipline combinations in the active mission field and its mission components (as a share of the total). Projects in the active mission field tend to combine Engineering and Technology with Medical Sciences, Medical Sciences with Mathematics and Computing, and Engineering and Technology with Mathematics and Computing. Disciplinary combinations involving Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities are harder to find.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_12_disc_combs.pdf}
    \caption{Pairwise combinations of disciplines in different categories}
    \label{fig:disc_pairs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Actors}
One goal of mission-oriented innovation policies is to lower barriers to entry for new actors in the innovation system by encouraging new combinations of knowledge less likely to be undertaken by incumbents. Here we develop indicators capturing whether actors in the fields we have been considering in our analysis are new entrants or `veterans' in the UK R\&I system.

First we consider `age’: have organisations in the active mission field been active in the R\&I system for longer or shorter than those in AI and chronic diseases? To estimate this, we calculate the first year that an actor received a grant according to our data and then average this value over all actors in a category. 

Contrary to expectation, Figure \ref{fig:actor_exp} shows that organisations participating in the active mission field tend to be older than those in AI and chronic diseases (‘All’ set of bars in the
figure below). One potential reason for this result is that the level of organisational resolution in GtR is quite low, capturing universities involved in hundreds and even thousands of projects rather than research teams and centres specialising in an domain.  When we focus our analysis on organisations that participate exclusively in the mission field (thus excluding many large institutions that are active in it together with many other fields), we find that the average time that an organisation has spent in the UK R\&D system is lower for participants in the active mission field than for organisations that participate exclusively in one of its mission components).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/fig_13_actor_experience.pdf}
    \caption{Mean organisational tenure in the UK R\&I system by research category and level of specialisation}
    \label{fig:actor_exp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:actor_projs} presents a similar exercise but focusing on the number of R\&I projects that organisations in different categories are involved in, once again distinguishing between organisations that specialise exclusively in a category, and calculating median number of projects instead of their mean in order to reduce the impact of outliers with thousands of projects (such as Russell Group Universities). 

Similarly to what we saw above, participants in the active mission field tend to be more active in the R&I system, while specialists are similar to those specialising in mission components, with a median project participation of one.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/fig_14_actor_projects.png}
    \caption{Actor median number of grants by category and level of specialisation}
    \label{fig:actor_projs}
\end{figure}

Here, we identify some of the leading actors in the active mission field. We calculate relative advantage indices that normalise an organisation’s share of activity in a field by its share of activity in all fields in order to capture whether it is specialised in a way that suggests a `comparative knowledge advantage' in a the field. One limitation of these indices is that their values can be noisy for organisations with lower levels of activity so we focus on larger organisations. Figure \ref{fig:top_orgs} presents the 50 organisations with the highest specialisation in the active mission field, identified from within the two hundred organisations with highest overall activity. We see that this list includes a varied range of universities, technology and biomedical companies, charities and public sector organisations. Interestingly, only 11 organisations in the top 50 of overall research activity appear in the top 50 for mission field activity, consistent with the idea that missions can involve new actors not in the `elite' of the R\&I system.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_15_top_orgs.pdf}
    \caption{Top 50 organisatins in the active mission field according to their revealed advantage index (selected from the top 200 organisations by research activity overall)}
    \label{fig:top_orgs}
\end{figure}

Finally, we consider the link between an organisation’s share of all activity in the active mission field, its components, and the total of research grant activity in the UK. Figure \ref{fig:share_corr} presents bivariate rank correlations between those variables. Its results further reinforce the idea that mission-oriented innovation policies could create new opportunities for younger and smaller research organisations: the correlation between share of activity in a mission field and share of total activity is lower than for the active mission field than for its mission components. Also we note with interest that the correlation between organisations' share of AI activity and share of the active mission field is higher than is the case with the share of chronic diseases, suggesting that organisations with strong AI capabilities have been more active deploying them to address chronic diseases than vice versa.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/fig_16_correlation.pdf}
    \caption{Correlation between organisational shares of activity in the mission field, its components and total research activity}
    \label{fig:share_corr}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Outputs}
The criteria for mission selection we outlined in Subsection \ref{tab:criteria} specify that a mission should be `ambitious but feasible’ - one way to explore this issue is by measuring if projects in the active mission field generate applied outputs. We do this with project output data available from GtR.

Figure \ref{fig:outputs} shows the ‘revealed advantage index’ for producing outputs in a category, including clinical products (predominantly software), spin-outs, publications and databases. We calculate this index by normalising the mean number of outputs per project in each category by the mean in all categories considered. A value above 1 indicates that, on average, a category tends to generate more outputs of a certain type than those we are comparing it with. We focus the analysis on projects started after 2012 to control for differences in the average age of different categories (as we showed before, active mission field and AI projects tend to be younger and therefore have had less time to generate outputs than projects in the chronic disease domain).

Our analysis suggests high levels of technological readiness in the active mission field. On average, its projects tend to generate more outputs along all considered dimensions. While this result is consistent with the idea that innovation missions  open up new and potentially productive technological trajectories, it also raises the question about policy additionality: if projects in the active mission field are already generating practical and potentially commercial outputs even before the Grand Challenge mission comes into play, what is the role of government intervention in this field?

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_17_outputs.pdf}
    \caption{Relative advantage index in different output types by category}
    \label{fig:outputs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Trajectories of the active mission field}
\label{subsec:trajectory}

We conclude our summary of findings with the results of our analysis of the trajectories in the active mission field.  Our analysis is based on the \texttt{TopSBM} analysis that we outlined in Subsection \ref{subsec:topic}. Table \ref{tab:topics} presents the topics that we extracted through this analysis at the second level of aggregation (comprising 71 topics).\footnote{The first level of aggregation has 491 topics, which is too detailed for reporting here, while the third level of aggregation comprises 13 topics, which is too aggregated.}. 

We have classified topics into the mission component they are more strongly related.\footnote{We do this by comparing the share of projects where the topic has a presence in one of the mission components with the share of projects with the topic in the population overall this}. In doing this, we aim to understand the level of influence of our two mission components in the active mission field. This is important because this influence could shape the types of problems that are tackled and the approaches that are used. One could for example imagine that researchers from the AI community may be specially attracted to domains with the large datasets required to train modern deep learning algorithms. Researchers approaching the field from a medical perspective may prefer to focus on disease areas that are more costly for the medical system. 

As we see in Table \ref{tab:topics}, the AI-related set of topics includes terms about robotics, language, networks, imaging and algorithms (as well as interestingly, one about ethics). The Chronic Disease topics mostly refer to disease areas including asthma, diabetes, pregnancy, cancer and HIV, as well as scientific terms in biotechnology such as cells or DNA. We also detect some noisy topics, and others capturing very generic vocabularies that researchers use when writing grants (eg \textbf{also research use new}).\footnote{A next step for us will be to explore strategies to remove these topics, for example by filtering out low-salience terms from the data before training the topic model.}

Figure \ref{fig:topic_distr} shows the percentage of active mission field projects where different topics are present, and their origin. We observe that the most prevalent topics are more strongly related to AI. Although some of them are quite generic and relate to impacts, results and methods, others are more AI-specific areas, concerning topics such as data, prediction, networks and applications. While this result could reflect the dominance of AI approaches in the active mission field (in line with the importance of computer science in the active mission field highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:disc_mix}), it could also be explained by the fact that AI techniques and methods are `general purpose' and applicable to many different projects, while disease areas will be more important in specific projects and less likely to appear across the corpus. Supporting this idea, the most important chronic disease related topic in the data is a generic one with terms such as `disease', `condition' and `symptom'. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/fig_18_distr.pdf}
    \caption{Share of projects with topic presence by origin}
    \label{fig:topic_distr}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:topic_comp} we present the topic composition of all projects in the active mission field ranked by the importance of AI-related topics. The lower panel presents the year when each project was funded in the vertical axis, the level of funding it received with the size of the marker, and the funder with its colour. As could be expected, projects strongly dominated by AI-topics tend to be funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) while those with a stronger medical component are funded more often by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Research Sciences (BBSRC). Having said this, the EPSRC is also involved in projects with a substantial chronic-disease element. 
The bottom panel of the figure helps us track the evolution of the active mission field in some detail. We see for example, that the BBSRC was an earlier entrant in the 2010s with a cluster of projects analysing genomic and imagining data. There is a collection of large scale projects funded by the MRC in the 2015s, including the Centre for Health service and Academic Partnership in Translational eHealth Research (CHAPTER), MICA (the Health e-Research Centre) and the University of Oxford Big Data Institute, all large scale initiatives to analyse big health datasets with data analytics, data science and machine learning. In recent years we see some evidence of diversification in the range of funders involved, and more projects where chronic disease topics play a stronger role.

    \caption{Topic composition of projects by origin (first row) and year of funding, funding size and funding body (second row)}
    \label{fig:topic_comp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:topic_evol} considers the evolution in the importance of different topics over time, based on their overall weight in the population. We see an increase in the total topic weight, in line with the increase in the number of projects and the areas they cover. The lower panel presents the evolution in the entropy (a measure of diversity) in AI-related and chronic disease related topics. This measure has remained stable in recent years, suggesting that the collection of trajectories being explored in the active mission field is not becoming narrower over time, possibly as a consequence of the participation of a wider range of funders in it.

\end{figure}

We conclude, in Figure \ref{fig:cd_importance}, by focusing on the evolution of the occurrence of various chronic-disease related topics in the active mission field. If we leave aside generic topics, we see that topics related to genetics, cancer, HIV and depression and mental health tend to appear more frequently in recent years, while topics related to ageing, obesity, asthma and pregnancy appear less often, suggesting that AI methods are being deployed less often in these areas. The figure illustrates how the kind of analysis we have presented in this sub-section could be used to identify `gaps' in a mission field, potentially prompting targeted funding interventions to address them.

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The exploratory analysis we have presented in this paper illustrates the potential of analysing open funding databases to produce novel indicators for mission-oriented R\&I policies.

In summary, we have shown that the UK mission to deploy Artificial Intelligence to transform the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases by 2030 is justified by the relative under-representation of projects related to chronic diseases in the population of projects that involve AI techniques. However, the number of projects in the active mission field have been growing rapidly in recent years, with increasing participation of Medical researchers. This is consistent with a model of diffusion where the deployment of AI for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases is initiated by computer scientists with expertise on machine learning methods and a focus on application areas where bigger datasets are available (such as imaging or genomics), followed by the adoption of these methods by medical researchers. An interesting question is the extent to which the technologies and tools developed in the former stream of research are suitable for the latter. 

The fact that the active mission field has been expanding long before the Government launched its mission will need to be taken into account when it comes to evaluating the impact of the challenge. It also raises the question of what changes in the current trajectory of the active mission field does the Government seek to achieve with its intervention, and what policies beyond research funding and support need to be in place to ensure that the outputs of the active mission field contribute to achieve the mission's transformational goals.

Our analysis also reveals a high degree of interdisciplinary crossover in the mission field, consistent with the idea that different bodies of knowledge are being combined as AI is deployed to treat chronic diseases. When we focus on research outputs, we find that projects in the active mission field are already producing applied outputs such as patents, software and spinouts,
suggesting that the mission field is technologically and commercially feasible and underscoring its potential.

We have also explored some basic characteristics of the organisations participating in the mission field, finding that those that specialise in it tend to be younger than those specialised in either mission component. One interpretation for this is that the application of AI in the chronic diseases domains requires/attracts new actors into the innovation system, again consistent with the rationale for the mission.

Finally, we have mapped research trajectories in the mission field using a bottom-up, topic modelling approach . Our initial results suggest that although AI-related topics are more prevalent in the field, in line with the importance of Mathematics and Computing , this is not leading to a loss of diversity in the range of trajectories being explored. This could reflect the diverse range of funders supporting the field from different disciplinary perspectives. We also identify some disease areas such as ageing, obesity and pregnancy-related issues with low levels of activity in the mission field - future research could seek to understand the reasons for these lags, and their policy implications.

\subsection{Limitations}
Our analysis is not with without limitations. First, and as discussed, our initial selection of chronic disease keywords has an element of arbitrariness - an important next step will be to validate and enrich this list with input from other stakeholders and domain experts, and in particular the research funders that organised the UK AI grand challenge. A better understanding of their scope of the domain and their specific objectives will help us hone our methodology and definitions further.

Second, our analysis is constrained by its focus on open research databases that exclude nonacademic research activities which could be relevant for a mission field. The abstracts in these open databases are not generally long enough to deploy more sophisticated forms of semantic analysis than what we have performed here, introducing noise in our indicators. We have for example found some instances where our classification generates false positives because AI or chronic-disease related terms appear in otherwise irrelevant abstracts, or capture generic big data, analytics and bioinformatics projects that mention chronic disease areas as an example application among many others. 

Some potential strategies to address this include incorporating into our analysis additional text about project outputs, but this would be at the expense of timeliness, given publication and patent lags etc., or accessing the full project proposals (which are currently unavailable.)

\subsection{Next steps}
The indicators that we have developed are relatively simple and therefore easy to communicate and explain, but this is at the cost of hiding some of the complexity of mission fields sitting in the intersection of domains. There are many opportunities to use network analysis to estimate structural characteristics of topic and organisational networks in mission fields and how they evolve in response to policy interventions. We plan to do this in future work. 

This brings us to the question of impact, which as discussed in the introduction is currently not included in our analysis. Being able to attribute macro impacts such as future changes in patient outcomes in chronic conditions to a R&I policy intervention like the one we are studying here is a daunting challenge that will require the deployment of health-specific data sources and careful experimental design. Being able to monitor the transition of R\&I outputs from research into application could help with this - and data sources such as GtR or CORDIS, through the Open AIRE repository of project outputs, would allow this kind of analysis. At the same time, it will be important to avoid losing sight of less direct but also important pathways to impact for the research funded as part of a mission, such as knowledge spillovers and skilled labour flows.

Geographical variation and clustering in the recipients of funding within the mission could help quantify these dimensions of impact, highlighting another interesting dimension of analysis (spatial) that we have not explored in this paper. 

Another obvious next step would be apply the approach that we have developed here to other innovation missions. This is an option as long as the activities related to other missions are captured in research funding databases, and we can extract keywords from their definition. The facility for this depends on the mission in question. For example, the mission that we selected for this paper has a relatively well defined set of keywords around `AI’ and `chronic diseases’ that can be mapped on the concepts of ‘solution space’ and ‘problem space’.\footnote{And even here there is ambiguity and contestability about the definition of AI and the classification of diseases in the `chronic' category.} This makes it easier to delineate and analyse the mission field. Other missions, such as the previously mentioned EU mission to reach zero emissions in EU cities by 2030 would require additional background research to identify bodies of research and knowledge that might contribute to achieving the goal in the context of urban infrastructures (the solution space).

The required information for implementing our approach is generally available from open datasets about research funding such as the Gateway to Research (which we have used here), the CORDIS database of EU Horizon 2020 funded projects, or the National Institutes of Health World Reporter database of health-related research (with the previous caveat about description length). We could also apply our mission mapping approach to other potentially relevant datasets such as patent databases, pre-prints or open source software (with the additional caveat that they will generally contain a narrow set of disciplines than what is available in broad-based research funding databases). All this means that the approach that we follow in this paper could be applied to other data sources, providing a more holistic view of the situation and evolution of a mission field.

\subsection{Policy implications}
The analysis that we have presented in this paper highlights the potential of open data sources and data science analysis for the production of indicators that could inform mission oriented-innovation policies. Our indicators capture key dimensions of mission-related activity, evolution and composition which should be of interest to policymakers who desire to harness the potential of missions to tackle important societal challenges with new technologies and spur the development of new industries and research fields while avoiding the risks of picking winners, capture by vested interests, or premature technology lock-in.

The sort of evidence base we have developed in this paper offers a rich, detailed description of an active mission field, its participants and its history, potentially encouraging a more precise articulation of the purposes of a mission and the strategies to achieve them going beyond activites that are taking place already, and striking the right balance between ambition and pragmatism. 

%We believe that the full potential of these methods and indicators will only be realised when they are embedded into interactive and flexible tools for data exploration that enable policymakers and other relevant stakeholders including participants in the mission field as well as users and the wider public to interrogate the data, monitor trends, identify gaps in the trajectories being pursued in a mission and identify opportunities for collaboration.
